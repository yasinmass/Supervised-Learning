## Supervised Learning Models

👉 Used when we have input (X) + target (y)
👉 Model learns from labeled data.

📌 A) Regression Models (Target = Continuous Number)

Linear Regression

Ridge Regression

Lasso Regression

Elastic Net

Polynomial Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

Gradient Boosting Regressor

XGBoost

Support Vector Regression

K-Nearest Neighbors Regressor

📌 B) Classification Models (Target = Category)

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

Gradient Boosting Classifier

K-Nearest Neighbors

Support Vector Machine

Naive Bayes

Linear Discriminant Analysis

## Unsupervised Learning Models

👉 Used when there is no target variable (no labels)
👉 Model finds patterns automatically.

📌 A) Clustering

K-Means

Hierarchical Clustering

DBSCAN

Gaussian Mixture Model

📌 B) Dimensionality Reduction

Principal Component Analysis

t-SNE

UMAP

## Semi-Supervised Learning (Mixed)

Used when:

Small labeled data

Large unlabeled data

Examples:

Self-training models

Label propagation methods

## Reinforcement Learning (Separate Category)

Q-Learning

Deep Q Network (DQN)

Policy Gradient

Actor-Critic

Used in:

Robotics

Game AI

Autonomous systems
